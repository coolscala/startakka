Quickly start with scala, sbt and akka. Clone this, get going, have fun now and worry about the details and all the monkeys later.

This includes the sbt project setup, a piece of sample code with remote actors and the eclipse project setup.

1. clone this repository 
2. install eclipse with the scala plugin
3. open the project and run it
4. have fun

Optionally, you can install scala and sbt command line and evolve from there. We use SBT for dependency management but the required libs have been checked in for you.
